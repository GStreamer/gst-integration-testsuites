The testsuites implemented in testsuites/ should follow the PEP8 coding style.

Git annex usage:
----------------

We should never use git annex sync to make sure we always keep a clean history.
So to add new annexed files that are not available online, you should follow
the following steps:

    $ git annex add medias/some/file/to.annex
    $ git commit
    $ git copy medias/some/file/to.annex --to gstqaassets # You could use any archive.org backend you want
    $ git push origin master # Considering  those new medias should go to master
    $ git push origin git-annex # So that information about how to retrieve those medias are shared with others!

If you just want to add files that are already available on the web (and that
you **know** will keep being available), you can just do

    $ git annex addurl http://some/url
    $ git mv url medias/where/it/should/go # You could cd first too.
    $ git annex fix # Make sure git annex fixes its symlinks
    $ git commit
