The testsuites implemented in testsuites/ should follow the PEP8 coding style.

## Add a new media file

We use `git-lfs` with a backup on the fdo server.

You need access to gstreamer.freedesktop.org to be able to upload media files and
`rsync` needs to be installed on the system

1)  Make sure to get all assets first doing:

  medias/get_files.py # no argument

2) Add your media file in the tree and generate the media_info:

  gst-validate-media-check-1.0 [--full] file://full_path_to/path/to/your/new/file -o medias/path/to/your/new/file

(you can also do it with gst-validate-launcher -G)

3) Make sure that you media file is tracked by `git-lfs`:

    git lfs track "*.file_extension"

4) Add the media info in git:

  git add medias/path/to/your/new/file.media_info
  git add medias/path/to/your/new/file

5) Check everything is ready to uploaded.

  python medias/upload_media_files.py # Dry run

6) Check and update the `medias/files.json` file

  git add medias/files.json

7) Generate the new tests list

  gst-validate-launcher -L
  git add testsuites/validate.testslist

8) Commit and push
